# React + Vite

This is the tuneSpot website. Using the API provided by the audioDB this website can search a large repository of music artists and allows users to gather a collection of their favorite videos in one easy site.

This website is built using react. Due to copyrights on most music videos, the items in a collection link to youtube, as most have embedding disabled to protect artist copyright.

PLEASE NOTE: This is a public use API key. I have a private key to use once the backend is secure, so currently artist ID searches will ALL return as daft punk
